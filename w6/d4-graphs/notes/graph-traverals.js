/*
You will utilize several different methods of traversing graphs. These include:
-breadth-first
-depth-first
-pre-order
-in-order
-post-order

These refer to the patterns in which the algorithm will access each node of the graph, 
depending on factors such as directed or undirected edges and weights.
